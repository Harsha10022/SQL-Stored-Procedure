# SQL-Stored Procedure
 
A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again.

So if you have an SQL query that you write over and over again, save it as a stored procedure, and then just call it to execute it.

In this stored procedure I have used select statement to fetch the data and insert statement to insert data into sales table and update statement to update the data
in products table.And I passed two input parameters into stored procedure.
